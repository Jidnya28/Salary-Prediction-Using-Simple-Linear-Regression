# Salary-Prediction-Using-Simple-Linear-Regression


This project builds a Simple Linear Regression model to predict employee salaries based on their years of experience. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and model training/testing using Python. Boxplots and distribution plots were used to detect outliers and understand data spread, while scatter plots with regression lines revealed the relationship between salary and experience.

The dataset is split into training and testing sets, after which a regression model is fitted to evaluate coefficients, visualize predictions, and compute performance metrics such as the R² score and Mean Squared Error. Finally, the model is tested with unseen data to generate salary predictions, demonstrating its real-world applicability.
